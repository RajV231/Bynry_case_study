# Bynry Case Study Solution

This repository contains my solution to the StockFlow inventory management case study.
The goal was to analyze an existing backend API, design a scalable database schema, and
implement a low-stock alert endpoint based on incomplete requirements.

The solution is divided into three parts:
- Part 1: Code review and debugging
- Part 2: Database design
- Part 3: Low-stock alerts API

Where requirements were unclear, I made reasonable assumptions and documented them.
